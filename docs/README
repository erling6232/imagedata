README
======

Documentation lives in docs/

You can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate
the HTML output by typing ``make html`` from the ``docs/`` directory.
The resulting HTML files will
be placed in ``_build/html/`` and are viewable in a web browser. See the
``README`` file in the ``docs/`` directory for more information.

For building the documentation, you will need
[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),
[numpy](http://numpy.org/), and
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).
