### Fixed
* Protected Series and Header objects for missing properties.

## [v3.3.0-rc1] - 2023-12-01

* Header: When using a template to create DicomHeaderDict, use deepcopy to get a unique
  DicomHeaderDict for the new instance.
### Added
* Viewer: Save window center/width to Series object when returning.
* Series.fuse_mask(): New parameter `blend` which determines whether
  the self image is blended. Default is False, such that the self image is
  not blended, only the mask is blended.

### Fixed
* Series: Handle the special case when a ufunc is called with a where= Series object used
  by NumPy >= 1.25.

## [v3.2.4-dev0] - 2023-11-14
### Added
* Series.write(..., opts={'window': 'original'}): Use original
  window center/level from data object, do not calculate window
  from present data.

  ufuncs if used as `where=`.

## [v3.2.3-dev0] - 2023-10-17
### Fixed
* Series: Protect for NaN values.
* Viewer: Protect for NaN values.
* Viewer: Display real part only of complex values.

## [v3.2.0] - 2023-10-11
### Added
* imagedata.__init__(): Import all plugins to enable plugin-specific initialisation,
   e.g. setting mimetypes.

## [v3.1.0] - 2023-09-05
### Fixed
* Restored logging facility in command-line utilities.
* Better logging when reader plugins fail.

## [v3.1.0-rc1] - 2023-09-01
### Fixed
* Collections error fixed.

## [v3.1.0-rc0] - 2023-09-01
### Added
* Viewer.update() and Viewer.onselect():
Call onselect when setting up display which includes a ROI.
This allows e.g. drawing a time curve on initial display.

### Fixed
* Corrected problem in collections where writing images failed when study datetime is None.
The study instance UID is used instead to construct directory names.

## [v3.0.0] - 2023-08-24
### Added
* Stable release.

### Changed
* Modified NIfTI reading/writing.
DICOM to NIfTI is now compatible with popular `dcm2niix` tool.

### Fixed
* Require itk-io version >= 5.3. Previous versions use the np.bool dtype.

## [v3.0.0-rc7] - 2023-08-23
### Fixed
* numpy.bool is deprecated.

## [v3.0.0-rc6] - 2023-08-17
### Fixed
* Series: Fixed a problem where calculated float window center and level could not be represented in DICOM DS tag.
Window center and level are now calculated using float32.
* Series: Calculate proper window center and level when a new instance is created.
* imagedata.formats.dicomplugin: write_slice will change Series into ndarray before rescaling content.
This avoids crosstalk with original window center and level in Series.

## [v3.0.0-rc5] - 2023-08-11
### Fixed
* imagedata.formats.niftiplugin: Corrected writing 4D images.
When the 4th dimension is not time, the zoom is set to 1.

### Added

* Drop dependency on importlib_metadata.
* Require numpy version 1.19 or later.
* Require nibabel version 5.0.0 or later.
* Drop support for Python 3.7.

### Fixed
* imagedata.formats.niftiplugin corrected for rotated volumes.
### Changed
* Drop support for Python 3.6.
* Require nibabel version 4.0.0 or later.

## [v3.0.0-rc2] - 2023-08-08

### Changed
* imagedata.formats.niftiplugin improved to handle nifti files
like the popular tool dcm2niix (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/dcm2nii/).
* Notice that nifti files written with imagedata prior to version 3 will be incompatible
with version 3 onwards.

* Study class: a collection of Series instances.
  Sort images into separate Series depending on SeriesInstanceUID.
  (https://github.com/erling6232/imagedata/issues/22)
* Patient and Cohort classes: Patient is a collection of Study instances,
  while Cohort is a collection of Patient instances.
* Simpler import statements in user code: `from imagedata import Series, Study`
