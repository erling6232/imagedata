<!--next-version-placeholder-->

## [v2.1.1] - 2023-05-15
### Changed
* Modified fetching package metadata and entry_points.
 
## [v2.1.0] - 2023-05-12
### Added
* imagedata.apps.diffusion module to extract diffusion MRI parameters.

## [v2.0.0] - 2023-02-13
### Added
* Study class: a collection of Series instances.
  Sort images into separate Series depending on SeriesInstanceUID.
  (https://github.com/erling6232/imagedata/issues/22)
* Patient and Cohort classes: Patient is a collection of Study instances,
  while Cohort is a collection of Patient instances.
* Simpler import statements in user code: `from imagedata import Series, Study`
* Add support Python 3.11 (https://github.com/erling6232/imagedata/issues/21)
* Series.to_rgb(): Added clip parameter whether clipping to DICOM window or
  to histogram probabilities.
* Series.fuse_mask(): Color fusion of mask.
* Added Series.align() method.
### Changed
* `input_order='auto'`: Auto-detect the sorting of Series,
  depending on which DICOM attribute varies.
  The input_orders time/b/fa/te are attempted in order.
* `auto` is now the default input_order.
* DWI images will typically have varying time. Let `b` values override the time stamps
  during auto-detect sorting of Series.
* The dicom read has been modified to keep the UIDs of the input files.
  This way SOPInstanceUIDs are correct when you later want to look up SOPInstanceUID from a DICOM PR.
* image_data.statistics: print patient, study and series properly.
* image_data.conversion: improved conversion of date/time for directory names.
* The series write() method now has an option to keep the UID when writing.
  The UIDs used to be modified at output to indicate that the data might have been modified.
  Do something like:

  a.write(destination, opts={'keep_uid': True})

## [v2.0.0-dev0] - 2022-12-19
### Added
* Study class: a collection of Series instances.
Sort images into separate Series depending on SeriesInstanceUID.
(https://github.com/erling6232/imagedata/issues/22)
* Simpler import statements in user code: from imagedata import Series, Study
* Add support Python 3.11 (https://github.com/erling6232/imagedata/issues/21)
### Changed

* `auto` is now the default input_order.
* DWI images will typically have varying time. Let `b` values override the time stamps
during auto-detect sorting of Series.

## [1.6.1]
### Fixed
* Viewer: self.callback_quit was uninitialized when show() was used.
* Series.__array_finalize__(): Copy Header object from any array object which has a Header object.
* Series.__getitem__(): Finalize ret object for all Series instances, independent on slicing status.
* Header.__init__(): No need to set self.axes explicitly.
* Series.axes(): Define RGB axis when last dimension is size 3 or 4 and uint8.
* Series.color: Color property is determined by the presence of an RGB axis. Do not set color property.
* Series.photometricInterpretation: Do not set color property.
* Remove all references to header.color. Color status is determined by the presence of an RGB axis.

## [1.6.0]

* show() and get_roi() works in Jupyter notebook, too.
* In notebook: Series.get_roi_mask() must be called after get_roi() to get the actual mask.

## [1.5.1]
### Fixed
* MyPolygonSelector.__init__(): define self._polygon_complete.
* Viewer.grid_from_roi(): Set input_order='none' for resulting mask when follow is False.
* Series.tags: Ensure that tag lists are always Numpy arrays.
* Series: Handle properly the situation where a template has wrong number of slices or tags.

## [1.5.0]

* Documentation updates.

## [1.4.4]
### Added
* Support for pydicom version 2.3.

* Do not scan all local subdirectories when looking up a specific file.
* Removed setup.py.

### Fixed
* Using relative imports for internal imagedata modules.

## [1.4.3]

* Specify exact python versions supported.
* Verify that template axes are adjusted to present data.
* Refactor calculation of smallest/largest pixel value in image/series.
* image_data.calculator: When no indirs arguments, calculate a new image, optionally with template and geometry given.

* ITKPlugin.get_image_from_numpy(): return image as np.ndarray, not itk matrix.
* Header.set_default_values(): Set default geometry.

## [1.4.2]
### Changed
* Set Pixel Representation depending on dtype.
* Handle DICOM signed integer depending on value of Pixel Representation.

## [1.4.1]
### Fixed
* Fixed problem where Window Center and Level with multiple pairs of windows were not read correctly.

## [1.4.0]
### Added
* New plugin architecture using python's entry_points.
* Added image_show console application.
### Changed
* imagedata_format_ps is split out in separate package.

## [1.3.8]
### Fixed
Dicomplugin.sort_images(): Re-raise exception when data cannot be sorted, or when tag is None.

## [1.3.7]
### Added
* Added Series.deepcopy().

* Header class: hdr is now a Header instance. Was: dict. Dict is no longer accepted.
* Viewer class now inherits object class.
* Series.setDicomAttribute(): Always make a new attribute to avoid cross-talk after copying Series instances.
### Fixed
* Format plugin classes: Header.add_template() and Header.add_geometry are now Header member functions.

## [1.3.6]
### Added
* Accept Path object as url.
* Series.get_roi: New parameter `single` when only one slice per tag has a ROI.
* Series.to_rgb(): Use matplotlib colormaps to create color images. Add colormap and lut parameters.
* Display colorbar when colormap is not grayscale, and image is not RGB image.
* Series.to_rgb(): Added option 'norm' to determine normalization method. Methods implemented: 'linear' and 'log'. Modified behavior to honor normalization method.
### Changed
* Moved formats.ps to separate package. Thereby removed dependency on ghostscript package.
* Default colormap is 'Greys_r'.
* Viewer: Renamed option `cmap` to `colormap`.
* Set appropriate Window Center and Width for new Series instance.
* Viewer: Let the delta increment of Window Center and Width depend on actual value range. Avoid non-positive Window Width. Let Window Center be a floating point number when less than 2.
### Fixed
* NiftiPlugin: Stable version where SForm matrices are read and written properly for coronal orientation.
* DICOMPlugin: Do not scale pixel data when RescaleSlope == 1 and RescaleIntercept == 0.
